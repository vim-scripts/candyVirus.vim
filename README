CandyVirus is a 256 colors elegant colorscheme wrote for vim term. It has been mainly test over C, C++ and Shell Script files, but should also work fine as long as you have good syntax files.
A white version can be displayed by using vim command 'CandyLight' but I'm not totally satisfied with it yet. ('CandyDark', 'or 'CandySwitch' to go back to the dark one).
